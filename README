Think-Blast is a space shooter game that uses a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to control the player-ship. A second player (co-pilot) uses the keyboard to control other movements of the ship, so the game is two-player co-op only. Think-Blast requires the use of an openBCI Cyton to provide BCI functionality. 

Depencies:
 - Python 2.7
 - All python modules in requirements.txt
 - OpenBCI_Processing (download latest version from OpenBCI Github)
 - Processing (required to run OpenBCI_GUI)

Instructions:
Step 1
Connect 8 electrodes to the Cyton board and user's head, following the 10-20 EEG system.
 - SRB:       Ear
 - Channel 1: O1
 - Channel 2: O2
 - Channel 3: OZ
 - Channel 4: P1
 - Channel 5: P3
 - Channel 6: Pz
 - Channel 7: C3
 - Channel 8: C4
 - Bias:      Ear
The electrodes can be applied using the UltraCortex headset, or with traditional wet electrodes.

Step 2
 - Run openBCI-GUI.
 - For "Data Source", select "Live from Cyton". Select the appropriate options for connecting to the headset dongle.
 - Ensure none of the inputs are "Railed". Adjust electrode placement if necessary.
 - Load the "Networking" widget panel.
 - Select "LSL" for stream type.
 - Select "Band Power" on stream index #0. Leave other options as default.
 - Press "Start Stream".

Step 3
- In a terminal, navigate to the src folder within the downloaded "think-blast" game directory.
- Execute the program: python game.py
- Follow the in-game prompts to first calibrate, and then play the game.
